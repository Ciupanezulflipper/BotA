# BotA Decisions Register

## Active Locked Decisions

### 2026-04-22 — Live watcher scope
- Decision: Keep live watcher scope at `EURUSD GBPUSD` on `M15`
- Status: LOCKED
- Why:
  - End-to-end recovery is proven for current live scope
  - USDJPY is technically validated, but not yet approved for live watcher scope
  - No infrastructure reason currently exists to widen live scope
- Not approved:
  - Adding `USDJPY` to live watcher
  - Lowering thresholds just to force alerts

### 2026-04-22 — Workflow standard
- Decision: Use evidence-driven workflow files as source of truth
- Status: LOCKED
- Required artifacts:
  - `CONTINUITY.md`
  - `state/STATE.json`
  - `DECISIONS.md`
  - `RESOLVED.md`
  - `tools/handoff_pack.sh`
- Rule:
  - No meaningful BotA fix is considered done until continuity + state + decision trail are updated
