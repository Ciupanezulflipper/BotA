# BotA Decisions Register

## Active Locked Decisions

### 2026-04-22 — Live watcher scope
- Decision: Keep live watcher scope at `EURUSD GBPUSD` on `M15`
- Status: LOCKED
- Why:
  - End-to-end recovery is proven for current live scope
  - USDJPY is technically validated, but not yet approved for live watcher scope
  - No infrastructure reason currently exists to widen live scope
- Not approved:
  - Adding `USDJPY` to live watcher
  - Lowering thresholds just to force alerts

### 2026-04-22 — Workflow standard
- Decision: Use evidence-driven workflow files as source of truth
- Status: LOCKED
- Required artifacts:
  - `CONTINUITY.md`
  - `state/STATE.json`
  - `DECISIONS.md`
  - `RESOLVED.md`
  - `tools/handoff_pack.sh`
- Rule:
  - No meaningful BotA fix is considered done until continuity + state + decision trail are updated

## signal_closer.py role — 2026-04-24
- Classification: manual guarded admin tool
- Not cron-managed (confirmed via crontab -l | grep closer = empty)
- Live execution requires: --live --confirm CLOSE_SIGNALS --max-batch N
- Bulk close requires: --allow-bulk
- Root cause of March 13: live default without guardrails — fixed in v2

## BotA git auth path — 2026-04-26
- Decision: BotA git auth path is SSH, not HTTPS+PAT
- Status: LOCKED
- Proven:
  - local SSH key authenticated successfully to GitHub
  - `git fetch origin` over SSH passed
  - `git push origin main` over SSH passed
  - BotA remote URL is `git@github.com:Ciupanezulflipper/BotA_Prod_2025_11.git`
- Consequence:
  - PAT is no longer required for normal BotA `git pull` / `git push`
- Do not change:
  - `origin` back to HTTPS unless there is a separately documented reason

## Auth path — 2026-04-25
- BotA git auth: SSH via ~/.ssh/id_ed25519 (migrated from HTTPS+PAT)
- Old PAT (ghp_miTfh...) was exposed in chat and revoked immediately
- ~/.git-credentials GitHub entry removed after revocation
- PAT no longer needed for BotA git operations
